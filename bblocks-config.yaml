  Building blocks for the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) suite - a mid-level ontology extending 
  Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) with eleven domain-agnostic ontologies for representing entities 
  across all domains of interest.

# Description for this collection
description: |
  This repository contains building blocks for the **Common Core Ontologies (CCO)** version 2.0,
  a widely-used suite of eleven ontologies that extend the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), an ISO 
  standard top-level ontology.
  
  The eleven CCO ontologies include:
  
  - **Agent Ontology**: Representation of agents (persons, organizations) and their roles
  - **Artifact Ontology**: Representation of manufactured objects, models, and functions
  - **Currency Unit Ontology**: Representation of currencies and monetary amounts
  - **Event Ontology**: Representation of processes and activities performed by agents
  - **Extended Relation Ontology**: Relations between entities at the CCO level
  - **Facility Ontology**: Representation of buildings and infrastructure
  - **Geospatial Ontology**: Representation of locations and spatial regions
  - **Information Entity Ontology**: Representation of information content and metadata
  - **Quality Ontology**: Representation of attributes, qualities, and measurements
  - **Time Ontology**: Representation of temporal regions and relations
  - **Units of Measure Ontology**: Representation of standard measurement units
  
  CCO has been designated as a baseline standard for formal ontology development by the US 
  Department of Defense and Intelligence Community, and is being evaluated as a mid-level 
  ontology standard by IEEE (PAR3195.1).
